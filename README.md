</div>

### Brief and Goals

ice_libs is collection of Cross-Platform Single-Header C libraries for doing a lot of stuff...

Libraries were originally designed to cover what other Single-Header libraries miss (ex. `sokol_time.h` does not have Sleep function...) and in the same time it tries to stick to the oldest C standard ANSI C (C89) as best as possible, Except if libraries were in need to do the implementation in C99, C++ (BeOS/Haiku, BlackBerry 10, UWP), or even Objective-C (Apple Platforms)

The libraries can detect the platform automatically to provide the suitable implementation, As they are able to run on any platform possible to implement like Mobile, Desktop, Web, Embeddable Platforms, and even Game Consoles (via Homebrew SDKs) with goal of keeping the portability and abstraction of them, Empowering softwares with high-level and user-friendly optimized API that does the same job without any changes required...

Also, The libraries are designed to be bindings-friendly so the developer can write/generate bindings for his favourite programming language with ease and no pain, And allows developers to do some customizations on their own like changing the call convention or changing default memory allocation functions, Giving the developers a full power to write softwares the way they like...

The libraries are Dual-Licensed, The developer can choose between MIT or Public Domain depending on his preferences, See license [here](#license) and if he is interested in more info he can check out the docs [here](https://github.com/Rabios/ice_libs/wiki)

### Story

ice_libs originally started by [Rabia Alhaffar](https://github.com/Rabios) in March 2021 when he was working on gamepad input support for a project called fegame, Which would be a Cross-Platform game framework that leverages a lisp-like scripting language called [fe](https://github.com/rxi/fe)

At that time Rabia saw a project called [gainput](https://gainput.johanneskuhlmann.de) which represents his idea, But it's written in C++ and had bit of bugs and doesn't even support some platforms! (like BSD)

So at that time he started with library called `crosspad.h` that designed to be a cross-platform gamepad input library, Which later evolved into `ice_joy.h` as the first ice_libs library being in development, Then in April he decided to stop working on fegame in order to extend the project workspace to have more libs and form ice_libs!
