10. Updated header implementations and samples to comply with `-Wextra` flag!
11. `ice_test.h` now asserts for being the strings are not `NULL` (or zero) when comparing using `ICE_TEST_ASSERT_STR_EQU` and also used `ICE_TEST_CREATE` instead of `ICE_TEST_CREATE_EX` in the usage example...
12. Added disable security pragmas for `ice_time.h` so it won't warn because we are not using the C11 secure versions of the standard C library functions...
13. The examples of the bindings with the samples by all were both tested with MSVC and GCC on Microsoft Windows and they should also work fine on any other C compiler or platform as it can use the suitable implementation...
